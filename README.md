# slack-bot architecture

This is a new and much improved version of my other GitHub repo, [slack-bot](https://github.com/Nickbohm555/slack-bot), and it includes filesystem management logic, better streaming, and better AI engineering principles that I will discuss further in my design doc.

**Accuracy improved from 50-60% to 85-95%.**

## Image #1

This is how the Slack bot conversation UI looks in the new screen-recorded demo:

## Demo

This is my new screen recorded demo. It shows a back-and-forth conversation with the Slack bot:

## How to run

### 1. Configure environment variables

Create a local `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these values in `.env` before starting the app:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: required for the agent runtime and eval scorer.
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: required to run the Slack app.
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`: required to run the Slack app in Socket Mode.

The current code expects the SQLite database file at `data/seed/synthetic_startup.sqlite`. If the file is missing, restore or place it there before starting the app.

### 2. Create the Slack app tokens

To get `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, create or open your Slack app at:

https://api.slack.com/apps

Slack docs for these token types:

- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` setup: https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket
- `connections:write` scope details: https://api.slack.com/scopes/connections%3Awrite
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` install and OAuth flow: https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2
- Slack token types overview: https://api.slack.com/concepts/token-types

Then configure:

1. Go to `Socket Mode` and enable it.
2. Create an app-level token with the `connections:write` scope.
   Use that value for `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.
3. Go to `OAuth & Permissions`.
4. Add the bot scopes your app needs.
5. Install or reinstall the app to your workspace.
6. Copy the bot user OAuth token.
   Use that value for `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.

### 3. Start the application

To run the Slack bot API service and Postgres:

```bash
docker compose up --build api-service postgres
```

This starts:

- `postgres`: checkpointing and runtime state storage
- `api-service`: the Slack listener and deep-agent runtime

Once the app is running, open Slack and go to the channel associated with the Slack app installation for your bot token. In my setup, that channel is `slackbot_ai`, which I created for testing the bot conversation flow.

### 3a. Database notes

The canonical SQLite snapshot for runtime reads is `data/seed/synthetic_startup.sqlite`.

`database_notes/` is a curated, repo-tracked filesystem layer that explains:
- how the schema works
- which joins are stable
- where customer-specific evidence usually lives
- which seeded accounts have curated dossiers and playbooks

Use the tracked seed file as the source of truth before editing or validating the notes:

```bash
git ls-files --error-unmatch data/seed/synthetic_startup.sqlite
```

### 4. Slack app requirements

To use the Slack bot end to end, your Slack app needs:

- a bot token for `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
- an app-level token for `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`
- Socket Mode enabled

## Containers

This project runs with three containers in `docker-compose.yml`:

- `postgres`: the Postgres container used for checkpointing and runtime state.
  Tables currently present in Postgres are `checkpoints`, `checkpoint_blobs`, `checkpoint_writes`, `checkpoint_migrations`, and `slack_conversation_sessions`.
- `api-service`: the backend container that spins up the deep-agent runtime and the Slack listener.
- `evals`: the eval container used to run the benchmark Q/A evaluations.

> [!NOTE]
> **Things I tried**
> I tried `create_agent` single agents, deep agents with subagents using the DB tools, deep agents with tools directly, various middleware approaches, skills with the deep agent, different OpenAI models, and Andrej Karpathy-style autoresearch.
>
> **Would I do a lot differently with more time?**
> Yes, lots.

> I gained a lot of insight into the tradeoffs, what was effective, and what was not. I'll talk more about my decisions and findings in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).
